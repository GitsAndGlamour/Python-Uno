# Python-Uno

Python Uno (Uno-Py) is a command-line game that plays just like the regular Uno card game, against the a computer.

There are 108 cards generated.

For ease-of-use, the entire game can be played using the 10-key pad.

Validations are in place to keep you (and the computer) from cheating each other (and yourselves).

Drawing a card is only an option when you don't have any applicable cards to play.

You can play multiple games and keep score of your total wins vs losses.

This game only covers official rules only. No stacking. :)

Have fun! 8)

I'll be adding tests soon...
